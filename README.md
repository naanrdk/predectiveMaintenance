# predectiveMaintenance
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Predictive Maintenance System (PMS) using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to monitor equipment sensor data, predict the likelihood of equipment failure, recommend maintenance actions, and generate comprehensive dashboard data for equipment health visualization.

## Usage

The system consists of the following main components:

### DataManager

The `DataManager` class provides placeholder methods for data access. It includes functions to retrieve sensor data for specific equipment and historical maintenance records. Replace these methods with actual data retrieval logic from your data source.

### PredictiveModel

The `PredictiveModel` class serves as a placeholder for the machine learning model used for predicting equipment failure likelihood. Replace the placeholder logic with your chosen machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for model training and prediction.

### PMA (Predictive Maintenance Analyzer)

The `PMA` class integrates the data manager and predictive model to perform various predictive maintenance tasks:

- `monitor_equipment(equipment_id)`: Monitors sensor data for anomalies indicative of equipment issues (placeholder logic).
- `predict_failure(equipment_id)`: Predicts the likelihood of equipment failure for a specific equipment ID using the trained model.
- `schedule_maintenance(equipment_id, prediction_probability)`: Recommends maintenance based on the predicted failure probability (placeholder logic).
- `generate_dashboard_data()`: Generates data for a comprehensive equipment health dashboard (placeholder logic).

### Main Functionality

The `main()` function demonstrates the usage of the PMS:

1. Initializes the data manager and predictive model (replace with actual implementations).
2. Creates an instance of the `PMA` class.
3. Simulates equipment monitoring (replace with real-time monitoring).
4. Predicts equipment failure likelihood.
5. Recommends maintenance based on prediction.
6. Generates data for a dashboard (placeholder).

To run the system, execute the `main()` function.

```python
python pm.py
